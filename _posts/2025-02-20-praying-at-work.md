> How can you manage daily prayers at work? What about attending Friday prayers?

A Muslim fresh graduate recently approached me with these questions leading up to his first day of work - questions I have been asked before by other Muslim graduates, usually with a background of growing up in a Muslim country, soon to embark on their professional career in Europe. Muslims are required to pray five times a day and Muslim men have an additional obligation to attend Friday prayers at a mosque. Yet I've noticed some hesitate to bring this up, perhaps fearing judgement from their colleagues.

I usually respond with, “Have you asked your supervisor?”

I cannot speak for other companies, but I have been fortunate to have worked in companies which were accommodating to providing a clean and quiet space to lay my prayer mat for 5-10 minutes in a working day. When I would ask for a prayer space in a job interview, the interviewer would make an effort to find some quiet space I could use - often a meeting room, or a meeting pod.

Fellow Muslims, assert your need to pray with your workplace!

- Block off the Jumu’a prayer in your calendar (taking care of daylight saving time).
- If you have the option to work remotely, consider doing so on a Friday.
- If you receive a meeting invitation for during the Friday prayers, kindly and professionally request for it to be rescheduled. Your boss won't bite!
